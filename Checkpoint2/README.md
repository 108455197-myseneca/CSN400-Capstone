### PART B - Inspecting Local Repo with `git status` amd `git log`

### What's the difference between `git log` and `git status`

Committed snapshots are displayed by the `git log` command. You may list, filter, and search the project history for certain modifications. `Git log` only functions on the committed history, but `git status` allows you to check the working directory and the staging area.

### PART C - Creating & Merging Branches

### PART D - Git Branching Strategy Review Question

1. What are the differences between develop branch and main branch?
The `develop` branch acts as an integration branch for features, while the `main` branch maintains the official release history. Adding a version number to every commit in the `main` branch is also practical. This branch will include the entire project history, however the `main` branch will only include a condensed version.

2. What are the three supporting branches? Briefly describe the function of each of these supporting branches.
`Feature` Branches, `Release` Branches, and `Hotfix` Branches are the three supporting branches.
The `Feature` Branch is used to create new features or modify existing ones. It enables programmers to work on a particular feature without interfering with the `main` development process.
A new software `release` is created using the `release` branch. It is frequently developed from the `develop` branch and given a particular name or version number.
Critical problems or issues are swiftly fixed using the `hotfix` branch. They diverge from the primary branch. They are employed to separate the fix from the current development and ensure that it does not.

3. What are the best practices in working with release branches?
- The release branch should always be set to 'public' 
- Branches from the 'develop' branch should use'semantic versioning' 
- Afterward, merges to the 'develop' and'main' branches 
- It must only be created with the Lead's approval
