### Part A - Creating & Configuring VMs - Using Portal

**1. What is the difference between Windows machine NSG and Linux machine NSG rules? Why? Do not give screenshots just describe the difference? Do you need a rule for ssh or rdp? What happens if you delete specific ssh and rdp rules?**
- Linux and Windows machines use different protocols and ports for their NSG rules. SSH (port 22) is typically used by Linux, while RDP (port 3389) is typically used by Windows. It may be possible to block remote access using SSH or RDP protocols by deleting specific rules.
